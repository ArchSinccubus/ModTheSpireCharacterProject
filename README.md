Hello everyone, and welcome to the Valiant! A new character added to Slay the Spire, fully playable with 75 cards and 9 unique relics both just for her personal use and for other characters!

General stats:
Starting HP: 90
Starting energy: 3
Starting gold: 99

Main mechanics:

Life loss: Cards that make you lose life for big effect. Like Ironclad, only way more and awesome.
Big game: Cards that cost 3 or more matters.
Healing: Cards that heal you HP and other general healing effects.
Smiting: Attacks that deal more damage if the target is suffering from a certain debuff, as well as cards that give said debuff.

The class also introduces two new keywords, which you'll see in-game. Can't give away all the spoilers here, after all!

Anyway, that should be about it! I really, really hope you all enjoy this mod that me and my brother worked hard on!

IMPORTANT NOTE: All the art in this mod is temporary. I plan to draw/animate/commission and whatever else is needed to make sure this mod has fully original art and animation. That, however, will just take time. Please keep in mind that eventually all card and character art will be replaced.

Select screen art was drawn by me. Like the others, it's a temporary piece that I had which looked fine, but I digress.
